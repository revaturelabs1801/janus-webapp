\chapter{Potential Improvements}
\section{Use containerization}
In micro-service architecture using containerization is ideal and save many debugging problems. Use docker swarm or PCF to configure and connect the micro-services.

\section{Use Message Queue}
In the current implementation we are using rest templates for internal service interaction. It is ideal for micro-service architecture to use streams to exchange data between services.

\section{Add channel to Hystrix dashboard}
Hystrix dashboard can used Turbine to track the health and circuit breaking of the services.

\section{Use and Add YOUR custom configuration}
Add your custom configurations to your configuration repository to match your architecture needs.

\section{Front-end}
Redo all of the services except the interceptors and everything will work flawlessly.

\chapter{Bugs}
\section{Front-end}
The front-end services except for the interceptors need to redone to allow more flexibility and usage though out the application.
\section{Configuration service}
Because we had to use our own EC2 we couldn't make use of the configuration service. The configurations of the micro-services are tightly coupled.

\section{Dashboard service}
Because we ran through many hardware problems we couldn't configure hystrix-dashboard properly. The service hydra-dashboard needs to be redone or not used.

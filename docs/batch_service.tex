\chapter{Batch Service}
\section{Abstract}
The batch micro-service is a major component of this micro-service system. It communicates with the user micro-service which gives individual details about each user in the system. They are tied together with keys but stored individually in completely different databases. The batch micro-service stores batch data within the batch repository. From here, it can send data to any other micro-service that needs batch data.

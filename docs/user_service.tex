\chapter{User Service}
\section{Abstract}
The user micro-service is the basic component of your micro-service system. It is responsible for all user data and persisting it within a repository. Any other business service that needs user data must contact the user micro-service. The initial user model in the monolith application, receives data from a BAM user controller and stores it in the BAM user repository. In this application, we have gotten rid of the BAM user controller and the services.
